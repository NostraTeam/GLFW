Standard GLFW with CMake support

This library is part of a project made by students of the htw saar (https://www.htwsaar.de/) and supervised 
by Dipl-Inf (FH) Christopher Olbertz.

**This code uses a modified version of GLFW (http://www.glfw.org/). The parts of GLFW that were written in C 
have remained unchanged, but the CMake parts have been rewritten on the base of the original GLFW CMake 
code.** The NostraTeam is not the author of GLFW.

The currently used GLFW version is 3.2.1.
